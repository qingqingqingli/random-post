## Installation

> **Disclaimer**: This application is developed and tested on `Linux` with `Android emulator` from `Android Studio`.

1. Follow up the official [React Native guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up the environment.

2. Clone the project
```shell
git clone https://github.com/qingqingqingli/random-post.git
```
3. Install dependencies
```shell
cd random-post

# with npm
npm install

# or with yarn
yarn install
```

4. Run the app
```shell
# step 1: start Metro in one terminal
npm start

# step 2: start the application
npx react-native run-android
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see the app running in your Android emulator shortly. If you can't get it to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/troubleshooting#content) page.
